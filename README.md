--------------------------------------------------
I specialize in Depth Image-Based Rendering (DIBR) and camera transformation algorithms. My work includes synthesizing new views of scenes using original images, depth maps, and camera parameters. I have implemented solutions in Python that apply advanced concepts like depth mapping, 3D reconstruction, and virtual camera projections to produce high-quality, geometrically consistent outputs.
